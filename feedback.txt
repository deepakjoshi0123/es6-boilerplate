ES6 is still nto implemente, try to figure out where are you stuck  - done
code commenting for class -done
Add a global method for logs and use it rather than in console logs 
constant file is there but it is not used in products controller -done
const is declared but never used  - done
code is not consistent for asyc await & promises 
common code for validation (Can it be done in middle ware than in each route ? )
common error handler is not good. There are other better approaches
respose handler(data :{} success : ) and req handler (validation in middle ware )
Internationalization logic is pending
make database querying things outside of the controllers
