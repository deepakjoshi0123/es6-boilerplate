ES6 is still nto implemente, try to figure out where are you stuck  - done
code commenting for class
Add a global method for logs and use it rather than in console logs
constant file is there but it is not used in products controller
const is declared but never used
code is not consistent for asyc await & promises
common code for validation (Can it be done in middle ware than in each route ? )
common error handler is not good. There are other better approaches
respose handler(data :{} success : ) and req handler (validation in middle ware )
Internationalization logic is pending
make database querying things outside of the controllers
